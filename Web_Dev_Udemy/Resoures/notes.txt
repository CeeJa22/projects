/// How Websites Actually Work?
    # The Internet:
        Consist of clients and servers, which communicate via wires buried all throught the world. You as a client send a request  for information and a DNS server connects you with
        the server and allows you to receive the data. 
        - Data is usually in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        -HTML:
            * Responsible for content, the information presented on the website and structure of the website. (SKELETON)
        -CSS:
            * Responsible for the styling of the website. (LOOKS)
        -JavaScript:
            *Responsible for the the functionality of the website, like adding supplies in a house that turns it int a home. Allows for the website to do things and be functional.
        
        Once the browser loads up the information from the website it starts to build the website then style it and after that makes it functional.
    
    
    
    # Tag Playbook:
        - <h1></h1> -- this is a level 1 heading created using an h1 tag; these can go from <h1> to <h6>.

        - <br> -- this is a line break, equal to what the '\n' does in python.

        - <hr> -- this is a horizontal rule, used to make a like across the screen, it can be changed in size. Example: <hr width = '500px'; size = '10>

            * All of these have the ability to include attributes within them, use documentation.
