        <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring web developer with a drive to learn as much as I can, and eventually become a full stack developer. I became interested in Computer Programming while I attended Kennesaw State University, where I graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice. I was in the senior year of my major when I realized I loved programming, so after I graduated I started my journey of teaching myself programming, so far I would consider myself intermediately expereinced in Python, HTML, CSS,and JavaScript. In the future I plan to go back to school for my Computer Science degree.</p>
